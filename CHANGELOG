	* Fixed a bug where compilation could occur if the "main" subroutine was omitted
	* Changed formatting for constant and scalar delcaration in sim.pl

0.00152
	* Removed "curly quotes" from the documentation (SIMPLE doesn't recognize curly quotes;
	  all examples in the documentation would not compile or run correctly if cut and pasted)
	* Changed release name to "cranberry"
	* Changed the name of the "nprint" command to "prints" (closer to natural English)
	* Added "fileio.sim" to the examples directory and to the documentation

0.00151
	* Updated the manual to use XML style comments in all examples
	* Fixed a bug in the usage display function
	* Fixed a bug in line counts (for error messages)
	* Updated copyright notice to 2013
	* Added the "split" command
	* Re-worked the way "write" and "append" commmands work (made those commands' syntax closer to English)
	* Changed compiled subroutines to use Perl subroutines (instead of injecting a block repeatedly, we put compiled code
	  into a Perl sub and call the subroutine)
	* Added more comments to the compiler source code
	* Changed the official SIMPLE logo
	* Added the "input" command
	* Fixed some grammatical errors in the manual
	* Re-worked "copy" command to be closer to English
	* Added the "move" command

0.00150
	* Input name for variable assignment is now interpolated
	* Changed the SIMPLE logo in the documentation
	* File I/O output is now interpolated
	* Added the "delete" command
	* Added "variables.sim" to the examples directory, with documentation in the manual
	* Added "new_default.sim" to the examples directory, with documentation in the manual

0.00143
	* Added command-line "bundling" for options (for exampme, using "-sev" instead of "-s -e -v")
	* Changed the executor stub's license from BSD to Perl;  this will allow the use of miscellaneous Perl subs/libraries
	* Added additional comments to the executor sub to denote the Perl licensed code
	* Changed the name of the --inject option to --include
	* Added the "encode" and "decode" commands, offering built-in Base64 support
	* Added encode_base64() and decode_base64() from MIME::Base64::Perl (by Gisle Aas) to the executor stub
	* Re-added "use warnings" to the compiler script
	* Now, encode() strips line breaks from output
	* Added table of contents to documentation
	* File I/O command inputs are now interpolated

0.00142
	* Changed executor stub comments to reflect that only the stub is
	  covered by the BSD license, and that any other code uses whatever
	  license its author chooses to use
	* Added the option to strip executor code from output
	* Reformatted the documentation
	* Fixed an error with return values (subroutines with spaces in their name were previously unaccounted for)
	* Added the Digest::MD5::Perl module to the compiler dependencies (used to fix the above problem)
	* Added "use strict" and "use warnings" back to the compiler code
	* Fixed a bug with label names and subroutine calls
	* Added the option to print compiler to STDOUT instead of to file
	* Made unique block ID's universally available via the new subroutine generate_end_block_id()
	* Added more comments to the compiler's source code
	* Expanded the use of the error system to all potential errors (previously, "file not found" errors would stop the compile, etc.)
	* Added the -i(inject) option, which injects the original source into the compiled source (for debugging)
	* Using --stdout now cancels out the use of --verbose (since we don't want verbose messages printed at the same time as output code)
	* Removed "use warnings" from the compiler due to unnecessary warnings

0.00141
	* Removed more syntax aliases ("=" is no longer a synonym for "equals")
	* Cleaned up the compiler's code
	* Cleaned up the executor stub's code
	* Executor stub now uses the BSD license, just like the compiler 
	* Added the "contains|has" conditional operator
	* Reworked the SIMPLE ASCII logo
	* Fixed documentation for "if" and "while" commands
	* Fixed some incorrect error messages
	* Removed destroy_scalar() from the executor stub, as it is not used
	* Added many, many more comments to the executor stub code
	* Re-added the "examples" folder, with new examples of SIMPLE code
	* Added comment headers to all example programs
	* Added references to example program filenames in the documentation
	* Added support for subroutines to have multiple return values (by that, I mean that
	  each subroutine can return different values depending on input)
	* Added support for a no-argument "return" command (exits sub without setting return value)

0.00140
	* Added support for local variables;  these variables will be destroyed upon
		completion of the code block
	* Local variables cannot overwrite global variables.  The list of global variables are
		kept separately from the local variables.
	* Added local command to documentation
	* Removed the two or three command aliases I put in for some reason;  if this language
		is supposed to be easy to learn, we shouldn't expect students to learn several
		names for each command
	* Removed the "examples" folder
